Wondering what is written in the above encoded codes?

Hmm!! It's not that hard. If you haven't found it yet, will give you a clue. It is a statement used by most of the programming languages to `greet` the programmer when they meet for the first time.

Yes. You have got it. It's `Hello World!`, whose characters are written in binary.
